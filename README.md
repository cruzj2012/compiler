The package phase12.jar contains all my work in the compiler project.

I have support for arrays. Handling local and global variables.

From Appel I can only run the program Factorial.java, and and altered version of BubbleSort.java
which goes included here. The only alterations I did, is the following:

I cannot do array1[i] = array2[k]. So what I did is:

aux = array2[k]
array1[i] = aux;

The Bubble contains all features I tried to implement. Local and Global variables access,
as well as handling arrays, and printing together with while and if statements and it
represents the best I can do so far.

I suppose with a bit more polishing I could successfully run more Appel's cases.

Smaller programs should run fine.
